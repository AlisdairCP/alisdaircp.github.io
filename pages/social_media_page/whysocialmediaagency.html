<h1>Why us?</h1>
<p>Just pop the kettle on, grab your favourite coffee, and learn why your business should hire a social media agency...</p>
<section id="why">
<p>To put things simply, we will save you a coffee bean-load of time, so to speak! While you're focusing on other areas of the business, we will handle how the brand should come across on your chosen social media sites. We will have everything covered. Think of it as though we're a cafe, only we serve social media treatment rather than coffee. Although depending on how you like things, we can make your content as sweet or strong as you so desire!</p>

<p>This area is most certainly our cup of coffee! We know what to say so as to please your customers. Our intentions are to get a load of indecisiveness when posting off of your chest. We will take care of everything on that from. What to say to customers with questions? We've got it covered. Got an event? We will promote in a way which will have the interests of your audience. All you have to do is to worry about the simple things; like if you take sugar with your coffee!</p>
