<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Alisdair CP. I am a student with a high degree of versatility in industry-relevant programming languages.</p>
<p>If you wish to contact me for work, then get in touch with me through an email using this address: alisdaircpage@gmail.com.</p>
<p>I have been using computers from an early age and wanted to learn the “ins and outs” of them during the days of my adolescence. The more scripts that I interacted with throughout my youth, such as websites, software and computer games, I realised that I had a desire to get into this kind of field and gain an understanding as to why developers make the decisions which show up in their final products.

<h2>What I do</h2>
<p>As a student, I'm working towards a BSc (Honours) in Computing and IT. Ever since I started in 2017, I have gained some expertise in languages such as Python, Java, and C++ and niche operating systems like Linux.<p>
<p>Outside of my University studies though, a hobby of mine is that of learning new programming languages. In my spare time, I have gained a strong level of knowledge in HTML, JavaScript, Java, CSS, PHP, C++ and SQL. The fields which I have the most expertise in are those of HTML, CSS, Java, Python and C++. Throughout my years as a University student, I was able to create several code dynamic websites which utilise all three of the aforementioned coding languages. I can confidently promise a web application that’s standards-compliant, usable, secure and accessible to disadvantaged clients.</p>
<p>I can also use my experience with Java, C++ and Python to assist with software development, or any other kind of application.</p>
<p>Asides from learning, my other hobbies consist of video editing, pet-sitting, especially for cats, trying to fix up worn-out systems, photography, cycling and hiking.
